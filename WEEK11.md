# Meeting

•	This will be the last meeting with Arnaud and Barrett as they will have to travel overseas this coming Thursday. As such, they suggested that we send drafts of the poster and paper for them to provide valuable feedback before we are graded.

•	In this meeting we discussed about the poster and how we should approach it. Our supervisors advised us that it was best to not use too much text and more visuals as it would be more appropriate. Because of the short period of time, they also suggest that we plan the entire speech and rehearse it to effectively use it. 

# Development
•	Time is running out to work on the project as we still have the poster due and the report to hand in. As such, I decided to spend a majority of this week fixing up as many bugs as possible and cleaning up the code to make it neater. 

•	My priority was to try and fix the portal perspectives. However, after many hours of debugging, I was unable to fix it. I will have to resort to using the standard shader with a render texture as an alternative. The effect doesn’t look as great but models the idea well and it will have to do as a conclusion of the project. 

•	I also discovered another collision problem in VR where if the player enters a portal they are not teleported through. This was fixed by assigning a ‘Player’ tag to the collision logic and checking for it to ensure that only the player is detected as moving through. 

•	Another problem which seem quite abnormal is that when starting the scene in Unity, the player is spawned not in a fixed location but rather at a position relative to where they are in the physical tracking space. This appears to be caused by some form of bug as that is not the default behaviour. 

•	Finally, I combined the map feature and the portal feature together to demonstrate how that navigation method might work. 

•	However, the other problems documented above was unable to be fixed in time due to the limited time constraints. 

# Poster
•	The poster will be due soon and will have to be started soon so we begin planning for it, so we can present. We will have to get it done soon because printing can be delayed, and we do not want to risk that. 

•	We decided to have it in the format with an introduction, methodology, results and conclusion. 

# Goals
•	Conduct heuristic evaluation

•	Finalise poster

•	Begin drafting final paper
