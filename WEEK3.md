# Meeting
It was decided by Arnaud and Barrett to have the meetings every Monday at Caulfield. We will be having a collaborative meeting with the group members of the other research topic being run in the same field. As both groups will both be using the same 3D model, it may be easier if we all work on it together.
During the meeting we began discussing the expectations of the project specification. Our supervisors gave us an idea of the structure and provided us with some literature that we can explore into. 
# Learning 
More learning was required in Unity before we can produce any outcomes. I completed a few more tutorials to better get an understanding of unity. I was able to import the model of the 3D scan into Unity and experimented with it. I tried to play around with different views and camera options to determine its effect. 
# Plans and Outcome
*	Continue learning Unity
*	Begin draft of project specification
*	Continue exploring VR literature
