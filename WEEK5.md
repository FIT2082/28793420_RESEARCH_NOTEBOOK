# Meeting
In this meeting we continued to discuss about existing works and literature on the topic. We established that around 20 literatures would be adequate to get a broad scope of existing navigation methods and implementations. We also were given recommendations of utilising software such as MeshFilter and MeshLab to clean up the 3D scan model. 

#Progress
- I have summarised around 10 literatures about existing VR navigation research and different methods. Two interesting ones were the method where distractors were used to redirect users and also 'NaviFields' which uses scaled displacement to adjust the movement speed of user allowing greater distances to be travelled. 
- I also had a chance to impport the model and successfully load it into Unity. I've encountered a few challenges however, I was able to resolve them. Firstly, the textures were not importing properly into Unity along with the mesh. This was resolved by modifying the '.mtl' file and it appeared to have been caused by encoding or some form of issue. The model also needed to be rotated and that took some time to figure out what direction it was in. 
- I've implemented a basic movement system which involve a first person view of the room. You can now move using the keyboard and mouse. However, this is just for testing purposes and will need to be redesigned to be suitable for VR use. 
- I spent some time looking at how to clean up the 3D scan and also software available to acheive this. However, I had little success due to the complexity of the programs. 

#Goal Next Week
- Begin developing and implementing some navigation methods
- Continue going through literature 
- Clean up 3D model
-
