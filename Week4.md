#Meeting
In this meeting, we discussed the Project Specification in much greater detail and established that this would be our main focus for the week with our supervisors. Within that meeting, we also further clarified any ambiguities or queries we had about the project and established what direction that we would want to take our project in. 

Currently, we plan to
- Review relevant literature, analyse and summarise the technqiues and their implementations
- Establish a basic model based on the 3D scans provided. It will need to be cleaned to remove artifacts and manually fix inperfections as a result of the scanning process. We also would implement basic movement within the 3D model and use that as the platform so that the other group can use. 
- Select certain navigation methods or innovate new one to implement and analyse

Furthermore, the meeting also provided an insight of what literature is out there in relation to VR navigation. Our supervisors gave us a few ideas to explore. 

#Project Specification 
After discussing the project specification with the supervisors, we established a general structure for it. Certain sections were particualrly useful towards our understanding of the project and also gave us a better idea of what direction we want to head towards. When I read through different literature, it has many great ideas which we can use and also add to our literature collection for further analysis. 

#Plan next week
- Continue learning Unity
- Clean up scanned model
- Implement basic navigation in Unity 
- Document literature in relation to VR navigation
