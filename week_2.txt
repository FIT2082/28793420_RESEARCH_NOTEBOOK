**Project Overview: Virtual Reality Navigation**

The problem with Virtual Reality (VR) navigation is that there are many constraints such as physical room size. Currently there are a vast range of techniques which can support navigation however each has their own advantages and limitations. The aim of the project is to investigate and implement different techniques in the navigation of 3D buildings.
Supervisor: Dr Arnaud Prouzeau

**Meeting**

This week was the first time I have met up with my supervisor to discuss the project. Before the meeting, I had a brief look at current VR navigation techniques and also installed Unity and played around with it.
We first established some expectations and ways which we can communicate effectively with each other. We decided that the meeting will be held on Monday 11am however that can be subject to change. We also agreed to utilise GitBucket as a repository and Google Docs, so we can access our weekly journals.

Arnaud gave me a tour of the lab and current research being conducted by other students. I was also given a demonstration of a range of VR and Augmented Reality projects. 

We also discussed a bit more in detail of what the project was about. Currently no work has been done to investigate 3D navigation. This will give Prince and I a bit more creative freedom however it will be a challenge to get everything running. Arnaud gave me a web demonstration of the 3D scans (meshes) which we will be using as a basis for our VR navigation investigations.

Before the meeting concluded, I was sent the meshes so I can try to load it in unity and play around with it.
